TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin

Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sys_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): sys_clk_IBUF_inst/O, Audio_inst/sys_clk, clk_deler/sys_clk
Related violations: <none>
